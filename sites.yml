      Microscopy Image Stitching Tool (MIST), is a stitching algorithm for

      new and novel method for optimizing the translations computed by the
      phase-correlation method using the Fourier transform approach. This new
      method estimates the microscope stage repeatability from the computed
      translations of a gridded image tiles. It then optimizes all translation
      computation using the Hill Climbing algorithm bounded to four times the
      stage repeatability. This minimizes the maximum uncertainty related to
      the translation computation for any pair of images.
