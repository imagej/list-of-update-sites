      method estimates the microscope stage repeatability from the computed
      translations of a gridded image tiles. It then optimizes all translation
      computation using the Hill Climbing algorithm bounded to four times the
      stage repeatability. This minimizes the maximum uncertainty related to
      the translation computation for any pair of images.

      This update sites provides ROI tools similar to the built-in ImageJ ROI,
      but with additional functionalities. A single cick generates a predefined ROI,
      adds it to the RoiManager, run "Measure" for the outlined region, and go to the next slice for stacks.
      These options can be modified by double-clicking the ROI icon.

      [XitoSBML](https://github.com/spatialsimulator/XitoSBML) is an ImageJ
      plugin which creates a
      [Spatial SBML](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/spatial)
      model from segmented images. XitoSBML is not just a converter, but also a
      spatial model editor so that users can add molecules(species), reactions
      and advection/diffusion coefficients to the converted Spatial SBML model.
