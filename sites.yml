      Microscopy Image Stitching Tool (MIST), is a stitching algorithm for

      new and novel method for optimizing the translations computed by the
      phase-correlation method using the Fourier transform approach. This new
      method estimates the microscope stage repeatability from the computed
      translations of a gridded image tiles. It then optimizes all translation
      computation using the Hill Climbing algorithm bounded to four times the
      stage repeatability. This minimizes the maximum uncertainty related to
      the translation computation for any pair of images.

      as well as nuclear bodies are segmented. As output, NucleusJ
      automatically measures 15 parameters quantifying shape and size of nuclei
      as well as intra-nuclear objects and the positioning of the objects
      within the nuclear volume.

      [XitoSBML](https://github.com/spatialsimulator/XitoSBML) is an ImageJ
      plugin which creates a
      [Spatial SBML](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/spatial)
      model from segmented images. XitoSBML is not just a converter, but also a
      spatial model editor so that users can add molecules(species), reactions
      and advection/diffusion coefficients to the converted Spatial SBML model.
