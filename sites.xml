The [[Updater]] has a convenient ''Manage update sites'' dialog that is populated by this wiki page.
* '''Users:''' You can [[How to follow a 3rd party update site|enable an update site]] using the {{bc | Help | Update...}} command and clicking the &quot;Manage update sites&quot; button.
* '''Developers:''' You can add [[How to set up and populate an update site|your own update site]] to this list by [[Special:CreateAccount|registering a wiki account]] and editing the table below yourself. Please maintain alphabetical order, but please do &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; change the format of the table—you will most likely break the [[updater]] if you do this.
